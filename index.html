<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  We will implement a two-dimensional interactive simulator with a top down view of fluid colliding with obstacles, 
  similar to running water in a stream. We plan to achieve this using 2D grid of attributes (velocity, density/pressure, vorticity) 
  that we can change in order to view different properties of the fluid. This grid of fluid attributes will also inform our visualization of
  the fluid and its simulated behavior.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>
  We want to utilize the Navier Stokes equations to visualize the flow of a consistent velocity fluid and 
  how that flow is disrupted by collision with obstacles. We will solve this by representing fluid as a 2D grid of 
  attributes.
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p align="middle"><b>Baseline Plan</b></p>
<p>
  Our primary deliverable is an interactive demo/simulation allowing a user to drag and create obstacles while observing how those obstacles affect the 
  flow of fluid. Our main implementation goals are listed below:
  <ul>
    <li>A 2D grid of fluid with the ability to switch between visualizations of fluid attributes, which shows how fluid moves around/is affected by obstacles.</li>
    <li>The ability for the user to interactively create/move/delete obstacles.</li>
  </ul>
  We want our final product to be able to accurately model fluid behaviors and their interactions with objects in a realistic manner. We aim to be able to 
  replicate existing real life phenomena that affect fluid behaviors using our simulation. 
</p>
<br>
<p align="middle"><b>Aspirational Plan</b></p>
<p>
  In addition to our baseline plan we would like to focus on these elements of the interactive demo if time allows:
  <ul>
    <li>A clean and elegant UI.</li>
    <li>The ability to change the direction of the stream or add multiple streams.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p align="middle"><b>Performance/Quality Measurments</b></p>
<p>
  As of now, we do not have any precise target metrics and will judge our program according to these general criteria:
  <ul>
    <li>Performance - ability to visualize flow in large/high res windows, with low latency. Interactive mode should be fast enough that a user doesn't 
      feel a lag when moving obstacles around. </li>
    <li>Quality - how good does it look visually, are particles moving as expected?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<p>
  Week 1:
  <ul>
    <li>Set up frameworks.</li>
    <li>Do research, lots of reading, begin doing detailed design of data structures and algorithms needed.</li>
  </ul>
  Week 2:
  <ul>
    <li>Implementing fluid behavior with the Navier Stokes equations, including support for obstacles.</li>
  </ul>
  Week 3:
  <ul>
    <li>Work on the visualization of the simulation.</li>
    <li>Debug fluid behavior with the help of this visualization.</li>
  </ul>
  Week 4:
  <ul>
    <li>Implement interactivity (adding/modifying obstacles, adjusting simulation area) and debug this implementation.</li>
    <li>Finish up the final presentation and record and edit necessary video and audio.</li>
  </ul>
